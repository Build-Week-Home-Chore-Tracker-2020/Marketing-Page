# Marketing-Page

This site represents the Marketing Page for our project build.
We created an application called ChoreTracker, that introduces a fun, interactive way to get chores done around the house. Parents assign chores to their children's accounts, and within the app they are able to see when the chore is due, how many points they have, etc. It promotes healthy competition in the household, creating enthusiasm that may not have existed prior to using our app. 
Our team is made up of a project lead and four developers, one backend, two front-end and one User Interface.
