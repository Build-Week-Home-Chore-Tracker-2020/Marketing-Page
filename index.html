        <h3>How It Works</h3>
    
        <p>Are you sick and tired of hearing your children complain about housework? Look no further, ChoreTracker is an application that allows parents to easily communicate tasks and chores to children. Parents/Guardians are able to assign chores to the child accounts, with a provided due-date. When chores are completed, the child can upload a photo of the completed chore to the application which then notifies the parent. That way, the parent can decide if the chore is actually complete. Each task has the same base point value, but children can achieve bonus points with CleanStreaks and consistency. Parents can use rewards as a tool for motivation. Whether it’s ice cream, an hour of screen time or a new happy meal toy, your child will have more enthusiasm to satisfy you with their hard work, all while teaching them how to act responsibly and independently. Instead of giving your child a 'time-out' or taking away their Nintendo Switch, give ChoreChallenge a try and never again will you find piles of dishes under the nightstand and dirty clothes under the bed.</p>

        <h3>Get Started!</h3>

        <p>Start by registering a parent account. Then, you can create a ‘Family’ by registering child accounts within your parent account. Children can sign in under their own account, allowing parents to assign chores to specific child accounts. Children will have access to their current list of tasks, as well as their ChoreScore and CleanStreaks. They are able to easily upload a photo of their completed chores to increase their ChoreScore and compete against the other family members!</p>
